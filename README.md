## Description
Many social networks function via utilizing the MongoDB database considering its speed while monitoring large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Here we'll be building APIs for a social network web application called Sociable Mediators. Users will be able to add each other as friends, share their thoughts, react to their friends' thoughts, and create a friend list.

## User Story

I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

BONUS: Remove a user's associated thoughts when deleted.
